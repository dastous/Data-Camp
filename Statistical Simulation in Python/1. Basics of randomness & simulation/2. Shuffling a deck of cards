#Often times we are interested in randomizing the order of a set of items. Consider a game of cards where you first shuffle the deck of cards or a game of scrabble where the letters are first mixed in a bag. As the final exercise of this section, you will learn another useful function - np.random.shuffle(). This function allows you to randomly shuffle a sequence in place. At the end of this exercise, you will know how to shuffle a deck of cards or any sequence of items.

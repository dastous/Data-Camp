#In the previous two exercises, we ran a permutation test for the difference in mean values. Now let's look at non-standard statistics.
#Suppose that you're interested in understanding the distribution of the donations received from websites A and B. For this, you want to see if there's a statistically significant difference in the median and the 80th percentile of the donations. Permutation testing gives you a wonderfully flexible framework for attacking such problems.
#Let's go through running a test to see if there's a difference in the median and the 80th percentile of the distribution of donations. As before, you're given the donations from the websites A and B in the variables donations_A and donations_B respectively.

#Set samples_percentile and samples_median equal to the difference in the 80th percentile and medians of permuted_A_datasets and permuted_B_datasets, respectively.

# Calculate the difference in 80th percentile and median for each of the permuted datasets (A and B)

#Set test_stat_percentile and test_stat_median equal to the difference in 80th percentile and medians of donations_A and donations_B (pre-loaded).

#Calculate the corresponding p-values p_val_percentile and p_val_median as two times the fraction of percentile and median samples, respectively, greater than or equal to the absolute value of the respective test statistics.

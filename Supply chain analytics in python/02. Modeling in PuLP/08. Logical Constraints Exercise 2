#Logical Constraints Exercise 2
#You work at a trucking distribution center and you need to decide which of 6 customer locations you will send a truck to. Your goal is to minimize the distance a truck travels.

#Product	Distance
#A	86
#B	95
#C	205
#D	229
#E	101
#F	209
#A dictionary dist, and a list cust have been created for you containing the distance, and name of each customer location. These inputs have been printed in console for you.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Update the constraints so that the model selects at least one location
#Add the constraint so that if location A is selected then location D is also selected.
#Add the constraint so that if location B is selected then location E is also selected.

model = LpProblem("Loading Truck Problem", LpMinimize)
x = LpVariable.dicts('ship_', cust, cat='Binary')
model += lpSum([dist[i]*x[i] for i in cust])

# Define Constraint
model += x['A'] + x['B'] + x['C'] + x['D'] + x['E'] + x['F'] >= 1
model += x['A'] - x['D'] <= 0
model += x['B'] - x['E'] <= 0

model.solve()
for i in cust:
    print("{} status {}".format(i, x[i].varValue))

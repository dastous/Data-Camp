#Decision Variables of Case Study
#Continue the case study of the Capacitated Plant Location model of a car manufacture. You are given four Pandas data frames demand, var_cost, fix_cost, and cap containing the regional demand (thous. of cars), variable production costs (thous. $US), fixed production costs (thous. $US), and production capacity (thous. of cars). All these variables have been printed to the console for your viewing.

#Initialize the class.
#Define the decision variables using LpVariable.dicts and python's list comprehension.

# Initialize Class
model = LpProblem("Capacitated Plant Location Model", LpMinimize)

# Define Decision Variables
loc = ['USA', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Brazil', 'India']
size = ['Low_Cap','High_Cap']
x = LpVariable.dicts("production_",
                     [(i,j) for i in loc for j in loc],
                     lowBound=0, upBound=None, cat='Continuous')
y = LpVariable.dicts("plant_", 
                     [(i,s) for s in size for i in loc], cat='Binary')

#Simulation Testing Solution Exercise
#You are working to minimize the transportation costs of shipping products from warehouses in New York, and Atlanta, to customers in the East, South, Midwest, and West regions of the US. The input data of transportation costs and demand for each region is given to you in the variable d which is printed in the console.

#Instructions 1/3
#35 XP
#Complete the code of the objective function that uses the random.normalvariate() method to add noise to the warehouse shipping estimates, centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 5.

# Add noise to the objective function
model += lpSum([(X[(c, w)] + (d.loc[c, w] + random.normalvariate(0,5)))
                for w in wh for c in cust])

#A function named run_pulp_model() has been created for you to solve and return results of the PuLP model using the random objective from step 1. Complete the code to call the function 100 times, saving the results in a list.

# Add noise to the objective function
model += lpSum([(X[(c, w)] + (d.loc[c, w] + random.normalvariate(0, 5)))
                for w in wh for c in cust])

# Call the function 100 times and append results to list
output = []
for i in range(100):
    output.append(run_pulp_model(d))
df = pd.DataFrame(output)

#Complete the code to print the distribution of the number of shipments to the Midwest and East regions from the Atlanta warehouse by using Pandas value_counts method.

# Add noise to the objective function
model += lpSum([(X[(c, w)] + (d.loc[c, w] + random.normalvariate(0, 5)))
                for w in wh for c in cust])

# Call the function 100 times and append results to list
output = []
for i in range(100):
    output.append(run_pulp_model(d))
df = pd.DataFrame(output)

# Print the value count df series Midwest from Atlanta
print(df['Midwest from Atlanta'].value_counts())

# Print the value count df series East from Atlanta
print(df['East from Atlanta'].value_counts())

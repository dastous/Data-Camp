#Interpreting Simulation Results Exercise
#In this exercise you are given the results of simulation testing of the Capacitated Plant Location model as a Pandas DataFrame called df. It contains the total production of the different regions. The optimal model results from each run of the simulation is stored as a row in the DataFrame. The first few rows of the DataFrame are printed for you. Your goal is to create histograms of the total production of the different regions to understand how the production varies in the simulation.

#Keep in mind that the production capacity for a low or high capacity plant is 500, or 1,500 respectively.

#Instructions 1/3
#35 XP
#Show the histogram of the Brazil region production. Notice how it seems like this region sometimes uses both a high and low capacity plant for production, because there are instances where production is greater than 1,500 (horizontal axis).

# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.title('Histogram of Prod. At Brazil Region')

# Histogram of Brazilian production
plt.hist(df['Brazil'])
plt.show()

#Show the histogram of the USA region production.
#Show the histogram of the Japan region production. Notice how USA and Japan both have stable production quantities, where 80% of the times the result is the same.

# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.title('Histogram of Prod. At USA Region')

# Histogram of USA production
plt.hist(df['USA'])
plt.show()
plt.title('Histogram of Prod. At Japan Region')

# Histogram of Japan production
plt.hist(df['Japan'])
plt.show()

#Instructions 3/3
#30 XP
#Show the histogram of the Germany region production. Notice how it seems that in the simulation, there were no instances when the German region produced any products.

# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.title('Histogram of Prod. At Germany Region')

# Histogram of Germany production
plt.hist(df['Germany'])
plt.show()

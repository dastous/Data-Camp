#Sensitivity Analysis Exercise
#You are doing the resource planning for a lawn furniture company. They manufacture decorative sets of legs for lawn chairs, benches, and tables from metal tubes using a two step process involving tube-bending, and welding. The profit the company receives from the sale of each product is $3 for a set of chair legs, $3 for a set of bench legs, and $5 for a set of table legs. You are trying to plan the production mix for the upcoming season. Unfortunately, due to a strike there is only 2000 lbs tubing available for production on-hand.

#The time and raw material requirements for each product are printed in the console. Also, the PuLP model has been completed for you and stored in the variable model. The constraints of the model are printed to the console.

#Complete the code to print the model status.
#Print values of the decision variables.
#Print the total profit by printing the value of the objective value.

model.solve()

# Print the Model Status
print("Model Status: {}".format(pulp.LpStatus[model.status]))

# Print the Decision Variables
for v in model.variables():
    print(v.name, "=", v.varValue)
    
# Print the Objective Value
print("Objective = ", value(model.objective))

#Complete the code to use a Pandas DataFrame to print the shadow price and slack of each constraint.

# Solve Model, Print Status, Desision Var, and Obj. Value
model.solve()
print("Model Status: {}".format(pulp.LpStatus[model.status]))
for v in model.variables():
    print(v.name, "=", v.varValue)
print("Objective = ", value(model.objective))

# Print Shadow Price and Slack
o = [{'name': name, 'shadow price': c.pi, 'slack': c.slack} 
     for name, c in model.constraints.items()]
print(pd.DataFrame(o))

#Question

#A local distributor has offered to sell the company more metal tubing at $0.60 / lb. Use the shadow prices and slack of the constraints, from Step 2, to select the best answer if this makes sense.
#Possible Answers:

#No, it does not make sense because the tubing is not a binding constraint.
#* Yes, it makes sense because the shadow price is $0.80 which is more than the cost of the new tubing.
#Yes, it makes sense because the slack is 333.33 which is more than the cost of the new tubing.

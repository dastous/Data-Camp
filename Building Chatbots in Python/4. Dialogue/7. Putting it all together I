#Putting it all together I
#It's time to put everything you've learned in the course together by combining the coffee ordering bot with the ELIZA rules from chapter 1.

#To begin, you'll define a function called chitchat_response(), which calls the predefined function match_rule() from back in chapter 1. This returns a response if the message matched an ELIZA template, and otherwise, None.

#The ELIZA rules are contained in a dictionary called eliza_rules.

#Instructions

#Define a chitchat_response() function which takes in a message argument.
#Call the match_rule() function with eliza_rules and message as arguments. Unpack the output into response and phrase.
#If the response is "default", return None.
#If "{0}" is in the response, replace the pronouns of the phrase using replace_pronouns(), and then include the phrase in the response by using .format() on response.

# Interleave chitchat and functional conversation.

# Define chitchat_response()
def chitchat_response(message):
    # Call match_rule()
    response, phrase = match_rule(eliza_rules,message)
    # Return none is response is "default"
    if response == "default":
        return None
    if '{0}' in response:
        # Replace the pronouns of phrase
        phrase = replace_pronouns(phrase)
        # Calculate the response
        response = response.format(phrase)
    return response

#Recommend repositories
#You're close to the end! Here, the task is to practice using set differences, and you'll apply it to recommending repositories from a second user that the first user should contribute to.

#Instructions

#Write a function called recommend_repositories() that accepts 3 arguments - G, from_user, and to_user - and returns the repositories that the from_user is connected to that the to_user is not connected to.
#Get the set of repositories the from_user has contributed to and store it as from_repos. To do this, first obtain the neighbors of from_user and use the set() function on this.
#Get the set of repositories the to_user has contributed to and store it as to_repos.
#Using the .difference() method, return the repositories that the from_user is connected to that the to_user is not connected to.
#Print the repositories to be recommended from 'u7909' to 'u2148'.

def recommend_repositories(G,from_user,to_user):
    # Get the set of repositories that from_user has contributed to
    from_repos = set(G.neighbors(from_user))
    # Get the set of repositories that to_user has contributed to
    to_repos = set(G.neighbors(to_user))

    # Identify repositories that the from_user is connected to that the to_user is not connected to
    return from_repos.difference(to_repos)

# Print the repositories to be recommended
print(recommend_repositories(G,'u7909','u2148'))

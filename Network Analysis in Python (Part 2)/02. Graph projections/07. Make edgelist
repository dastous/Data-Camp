#Make edgelist
#Now, you're going to apply the same ideas to making an edge list. Go forth and give it a shot!

#As with the previous exercise, run G.edges(data=True)[0] in the IPython Shell to get a feel for the edge list data structure before proceeding.

#Instructions

#Initialize a list called edgelist to store each edge as a record.
#Use a for loop to iterate over the edges of G_people. Inside the loop:
#Initialize a dictionary called edgeinfo that shows edge information.
#Update the edgeinfo dictionary with the metadata dictionary d.
#Append the edgeinfo dictionary to edgelist.
#Create a pandas DataFrame of the edgelist called edge_df.


# Initialize a list to store each edge as a record: edgelist
edgelist = []
for n1, n2, d in G_people.edges(data=True):
    # Initialize a dictionary that shows edge information: edgeinfo
    edgeinfo = {'node1':n1, 'node2':n2}
    
    # Update the edgeinfo data with the edge metadata
    edgeinfo.update(d)
    
    # Append the edgeinfo to the edgelist
    edgelist.append(edgeinfo)
    
# Create a pandas DataFrame of the edgelist: edge_df
edge_df = pd.DataFrame(edgelist)
print(edge_df.head())

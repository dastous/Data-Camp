#Less than 100 years ago, the universe appeared to be composed of a single static galaxy, containing perhaps a million stars. Today we have observations of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, all moving.

#The beginnings of the modern physical science of cosmology came with the publication in 1929 by Edwin Hubble that included use of a linear model.

#In this exercise, you will build a model whose slope will give Hubble's Constant, which describes the velocity of galaxies as a linear function of distance from Earth.

#Instructions

#Use the pre-loaded DataFrame with columns names, distances, and velocities.
#To model a linear relationship between velocities and distances, use formula="velocities ~ distances".
#build and fit a model using ols().fit() with formula="velocities ~ distances" and data=df.
#Extract the intercept from model_fit.params and the intercept spread from model_fit.bse.

# Fit the model, based on the form of the formula
model_fit = ols(formula="velocities ~ distances", data=df).fit()

# Extract the model parameters and associated "errors" or uncertainties
a0 = model_fit.params['Intercept']
a1 = model_fit.params['distances']
e0 = model_fit.bse['Intercept']
e1 = model_fit.bse['distances']

# Print the results
print('For slope a1={:.02f}, the uncertainty in a1 is {:.02f}'.format(a1, e1))
print('For intercept a0={:.02f}, the uncertainty in a0 is {:.02f}'.format(a0, e0))

#Building linear models is an automated way of doing something we can roughly do "manually" with data visualization and a lot of trial-and-error. The visual method is not the most efficient or precise method, but it does illustrate the concepts very well, so let's try it!

#Given some measured data, your goal is to guess values for slope and intercept, pass them into the model, and adjust your guess until the resulting model fits the data. Use the provided data xd, yd, and the provided function model() to create model predictions. Compare the predictions and data using the provided plot_data_and_model().

#Instructions

#Use the predefined function xm, ym = model(intercept, slope) to generate model predictions.
#Use the provided function fig = plot_data_and_model(xd, yd, xm, ym) to plot the measured data (xd, yd) and the modeled predictions (xm, ym) together.
#If the model does not fit the data, try different values for slope and intercept and rerun your code.
#Repeat until you believe you have the best values for slope and intercept, then submit your answer.

# Look at the plot data and guess initial trial values
trial_slope = 1
trial_intercept = 2

# input thoses guesses into the model function to compute the model values.
xm, ym = model(trial_intercept, trial_slope)

# Compare your your model to the data with the plot function
fig = plot_data_and_model(xd, yd, xm, ym)
plt.show()

# Repeat the steps above until your slope and intercept guess makes the model line up with the data.
final_slope = 1
final_intercept = 2

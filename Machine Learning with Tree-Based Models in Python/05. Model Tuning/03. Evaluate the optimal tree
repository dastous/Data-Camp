#In this exercise, you'll evaluate the test set ROC AUC score of grid_dt's optimal model.
#The dataset is already loaded and processed for you (numerical features are standardized); it is split into 80% train and 20% test. X_test, y_test are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the trained GridSearchCV object grid_dt that you instantiated in the previous exercise. Note that grid_dt was trained as follows:
#grid_dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Import roc_auc_score from sklearn.metrics.
#Extract the .best_estimator_ attribute from grid_dt and assign it to best_model.
#Predict the test set probabilities of obtaining the positive class y_pred_proba.
#Compute the test set ROC AUC score test_roc_auc of best_model.

# Import roc_auc_score from sklearn.metrics
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Extract the best estimator
best_model = grid_dt.best_estimator_

# Predict the test set probabilities of the positive class
y_pred_proba = best_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]

# Compute test_roc_auc
test_roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test,y_pred_proba)

# Print test_roc_auc
print('Test set ROC AUC score: {:.3f}'.format(test_roc_auc))

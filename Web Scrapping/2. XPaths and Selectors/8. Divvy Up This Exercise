divs[2] is a Selector object, which is the third div element in the HTML code. -*-
By chaining, the codedivs[2].xpath('./*') will select all the children of the third div element.
The code len( divs[2].xpath('./*') ) gives the total number of children of the third div element in the HTML code.
divs[2] is another SelectorList of length 2

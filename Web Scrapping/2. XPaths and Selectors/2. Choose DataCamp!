#In this exercise, we want to give you the opportunity to create your own XPath string to achieve a certain task; the task is to select the paragraph element containing the text "Choose DataCamp!".

#Consider the following HTML:

<html>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>Hello World!</p>
      <div>
        <p>Choose DataCamp!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Thanks for Watching!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
#We have created the function print_element_text() for you, which will print the text contained in your element (if it contains any). Feel free to use this function to check if your solution is correct!

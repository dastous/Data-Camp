#In this exercise, we have set up a spider class which, when finished, will retrieve the author names from a shortened version of the DataCamp course directory. The URL for the shortened version is stored in the variable url_short. Your job will be to create the list of extracted author names in the parse method of the spider.

#Two things you should know:

#You will be using the response object and the css method here.
#The course author names are defined by the text within the paragraph p elements belonging to the class course-block__author-name
#You can inspect the spider using the function inspect_spider() that we built for you -- it will print out the author names you find!

#Note that this and the remaining exercises in this chapter may take some time to load.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Fill in the required arguments to the parse method so that it will work as required when called in the start_requests method.
#Within the parse method, create a variable author_names, which is a list of strings created by extracting the text from the paragraph elements belonging to the class course-block__author-name.

# Import the scrapy library
import scrapy

# Create the Spider class
class DCspider( scrapy.Spider ):
  name = 'dcspider'
  # start_requests method
  def start_requests( self ):
    yield scrapy.Request( url = url_short, callback = self.parse )
  # parse method
  def parse( self, response ):
    # Create an extracted list of course author names
    author_names = response.css( 'p.course-block__author-name::text' ).extract()
    # Here we will just return the list of Authors
    return author_names
  
# Inspect the spider
inspect_spider( DCspider )

#You can use the wildcard * in CSS Locators too! In fact, we can use it in a similar way, when we want to ignore the tag type. For example:

#The CSS Locator string '*' selects all elements in the HTML document.
#The CSS Locator string '*.class-1' selects all elements which belong to class-1, but this is unnecessary since the string '.class-1' will also do the same job.
#The CSS Locator string '*#uid' selects the element with id attribute equal to uid, but this is unnecessary since the string '#uid' will also do the same job.
#In this exercise, we want you to work by analogy with the wildcard character you know from XPath notation to discover how to select all the children of a certain element in CSS Locator notation.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Assign to the variable css_locator a CSS Locator string which will select all children (regardless of tag-type) of the unique element in the HTML document that has its id attribute equal to uid.

# Create the CSS Locator to all children of the element whose id is uid
css_locator = '#uid > *'

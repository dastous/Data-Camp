#We did a cute trick in the lesson to calculate how many children there were of one of the div elements belonging to the class course-block. Here we ask you to find the number of children of a mystery element (already stored within a Selector object, so you can use the xpath or css method).

#To be explicit, we have created the Selector object mystery in the following way:

#We first loaded a Response variable using a secret website as the input.
#Then we used a call to the xpath method to create a SelectorList of elements (but we won't say which ones)
#Finally, we let mystery be the first Selector object of this SelectorList.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Fill in the blank below to chain on a call to xpath so that we can calculate the number of children of the mystery element; we assign this number to the variable how_many_kids.

# Calculate the number of children of the mystery element
how_many_kids = len( mystery.xpath( './*' ) )

# Print out the number
print( "The number of elements you selected was:", how_many_kids )

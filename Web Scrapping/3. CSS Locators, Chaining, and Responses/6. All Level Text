#This exercise is similar to the previous, but differs in that you will be selecting text from multiple generations of a given element.

#You will write an XPath and CSS Locator strings to direct to the text of a specific paragraph p element. The p element in the HTML is uniquely defined by its id attribute, which is "p3". With this small piece of information, you should be able to create the desired strings; however, we have preloaded the variable html with a string containing the HTML in which this link belongs, if you want to peruse it.

#In this exercise, you will only be selecting the text within the element which includes all text within the future generations. We have created a function print_results for you to compare which elements your strings direct to.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Assign to the variable xpath an XPath string directing to the text within the paragraph p element with id equal to p3, which includes the text of future generations of this p element.
#Assign to the variable css_locator a CSS Locator string directing to this same text.

# Create an XPath string to the desired text.
xpath = '//p[@id="p3"]//text()'

# Create a CSS Locator string to the desired text.
css_locator = 'p#p3 ::text'

# Print the text from our selections
print_results( xpath, css_locator )

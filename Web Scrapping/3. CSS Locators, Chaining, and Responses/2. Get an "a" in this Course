#We have loaded the HTML from a secret website which you will use to set up a Selector object and the function how_many_elements(). When passing this function a CSS Locator string, it will print out the number of elements that the CSS Locator you wrote has selected.

#In the second part of this problem, we want you to create a CSS Locator string which will select a certain collection of elements as described here: Select the hyperlink (a element) children of all div elements belonging to the class "course-block" (that is, any div element with a class attribute such that "course-block" is one of the classes assigned). The number of such elements is 11, so you can check your solution with how_many_elements if you choose.

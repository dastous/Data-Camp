#Similar to the work given in the previous lesson, we will have you use a pre-loaded Response object, named response to scrape the course titles from the (shortened version of the) DataCamp course directory https://www.datacamp.com/courses/all. To successfully do so, you only need to know the following

#The course titles are the text from all the h4 elements within the HTML document.
#We ask you to extract these course titles here.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Using response, assign to the variable crs_title_els a SelectorList of the selected course titles.
#Assign to the variable crs_titles a list created by extracting the course titles from crs_title_els.

# Create a SelectorList of the course titles
crs_title_els = response.css( 'h4::text' )

# Extract the course titles 
crs_titles = crs_title_els.extract()

# Print out the course titles 
for el in crs_titles:
  print( ">>", el )

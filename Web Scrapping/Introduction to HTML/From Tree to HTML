#To note:

#We have started the string html for you, to help nudge you in the correct direction.
#The spacing we use in the portion of the string we provide (e.g., indenting <head> two spaces more than <html>) isn't necessary, but we did so just to make it easier to read.

#Instructions

#Fill in the blank within the string variable html so that the HTML code matches its tree representation (including the text within the paragraph elements).

#In the lecture, we learned how to use double forward-slashes to navigate to all future generations. In this exercise, you will select all paragraph p elements within the HTML. Because we want you to navigate to all paragraph elements, it is not important that you know what the HTML code is, since the task can be accomplished with a simple XPath string using the double forward-slash notation you have learned.

#Defining variables
#Unlike a constant, a variable's value can be modified. This will be quite useful when we want to train a model by updating its parameters. Constants can't be used for this purpose, so variables are the natural choice.

#Let's try defining and working with a variable. Note that Variable(), which is used to create a variable tensor, has been imported from tensorflow and is available to use in the exercise.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Define a variable, X, as the 1-dimensional tensor: [1, 2, 3, 4].
#Print X. What did this tell you?
#Apply .numpy() to X and assign it to Z.
#Print Z. What did this tell you?

# Define the 1-dimensional variable X
X = Variable([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Print the variable X
print(X)

# Convert X to a numpy array and assign it to Z
Z = X.numpy()

# Print Z
print(Z)

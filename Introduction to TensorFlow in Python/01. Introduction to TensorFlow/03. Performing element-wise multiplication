#Performing element-wise multiplication
#Element-wise multiplication in TensorFlow is performed using two tensors with identical shapes. This is because the operation multiplies elements in corresponding positions in the two tensors. An example of an element-wise multiplication, denoted by the ⊙ symbol, is shown below:

#[1 2 2 1]⊙[3 2 1 5]=[3 4 2 5]
#In this exercise, you will perform element-wise multiplication, paying careful attention to the shape of the tensors you multiply. Note that multiply(), constant(), and ones_like() have been imported for you.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Define the tensors A0 and B0 as constants.
#Set A1 to be a tensor of ones with the same shape as A0.
#Set B1 to be a tensor of ones with the same shape as B0.
#Set A2 and B2 equal to the element-wise products of A0 and A1, and B0 and B1, respectively.

# Define tensors A0 and B0 as constants
A0 = constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
B0 = constant([[1, 2, 3], [1, 6, 4]])

# Define A1 and B1 to have the correct shape
A1 = ones_like(A0)
B1 = ones_like(B0)

# Perform element-wise multiplication
A2 = A0*A1
B2 = B0*B1

# Print the tensors A2 and B2
print(A2.numpy())
print(B2.numpy())

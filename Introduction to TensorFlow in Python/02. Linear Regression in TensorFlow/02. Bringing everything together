#Bringing everything together
#In previous exercises, you loaded data using pandas and explored how to set data types using np.array() and tf.cast(). In this exercise, you will bring everything together, starting where the previous exercise ended: housing is available and pandas has been imported as pd. You will import numpy and tensorflow, and define tensors that are usable in tensorflow using columns in housing with a given data type. Recall that you can select the price column, for instance, from housing using housing['price'].

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Import numpy and tensorflow under their standard aliases.
#Use a numpy array to set the tensor price to have a data type of 32-bit floating point number
#Use the tensorflow function cast() to set the tensor waterfront to have a Boolean data type.
#Print price and then waterfront. Did you notice any important differences?

# Import numpy and tensorflow with their standard aliases
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Use a numpy array to define price as a 32-bit float
price = np.array(housing['price'], np.float32)

# Define waterfront as a Boolean using cast
waterfront = tf.cast(housing['waterfront'],tf.bool)

# Print price and waterfront
print(price)
print(waterfront)

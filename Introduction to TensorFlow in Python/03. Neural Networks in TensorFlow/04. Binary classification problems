#Binary classification problems
#In this exercise, you will again make use of credit card data. The target variable, default, indicates whether a credit card holder defaults on her payment in the following period. Since there are only two options--default or not--this is a binary classification problem. While the dataset has many features, you will focus on just three: the size of the three latest credit card bills.

#The tensor of features has been loaded and is available as payments. Additionally, the constant(), float32, and keras.layers.Dense() operations are available.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Define input_layer as a 32-bit floating point constant tensor using payments.
#Set dense_layer_1 to be a dense layer with 3 output nodes and a relu activation function.
#Set dense_layer_2 to be a dense layer with 2 output nodes and a relu activation function.
#Set the output layer to be a dense layer with a single output node and a sigmoid activation function.


# Construct input layer from features
input_layer = constant(payments, float32)

# Define first dense layer
dense_layer_1 = keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='relu')(input_layer)

# Define second dense layer
dense_layer_2 = keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='relu')(dense_layer_1)

# Define output layer
output_layer = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense_layer_2)

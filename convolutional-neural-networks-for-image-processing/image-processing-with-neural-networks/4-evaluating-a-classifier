#Evaluating a classifier

#To evaluate a classifier, we need to test it on images that were not used during training. 
#This is called "cross-validation": a prediction of the class (e.g., t-shirt, dress or show) is made from each of the test images, 
#and these predictions are compared with the true labels of these images.

#The results of cross-validation are provided as one-hot encoded arrays: test_labels and predictions.

#Instructions +100XP
#Multiply the arrays with each other and sum the result to find the total number of correct predictions.
#Find the proportion of correct predictions.

#script.py

# Calculate the number of correct predictions
number_correct = (test_labels*predictions).sum()
print(number_correct)

# Calculate the proportion of correct predictions
proportion_correct = (number_correct/8).sum()  #this one i am not sure, i believe there are other way
print(proportion_correct)

#Modules (sometimes called packages or libraries) help group together related sets of tools in Python. In this exercise, we'll examine two modules that are frequently used by Data Scientists:

#statsmodels: used in machine learning; usually aliased as sm
#seaborn: a visualization library; usually aliased as sns
#Note that each module has a standard alias, which allows you to access the tools inside of the module without typing as many characters. For example, aliasing lets us shorten seaborn.scatterplot() to sns.scatterplot().

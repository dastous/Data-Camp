#We know that Freddy Frequentist is the one who kidnapped Bayes the Golden Retriever. Now we need to learn where he is hiding.
#Our friends at the police station have acquired cell phone data, which gives some of Freddie's locations over the past three weeks. It's stored in the DataFrame cellphone. The x-coordinates are in the column 'x' and the y-coordinates are in the column 'y'.
#The matplotlib module has been imported under the alias plt.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Display the first five rows of the DataFrame and determine which columns to plot
#Create a scatter plot of the data in cellphone.

# Explore the data
print(cellphone.head())

# Create a scatter plot of the data from the DataFrame cellphone
plt.scatter(cellphone.x, cellphone.y)

# Add labels
plt.ylabel('Longitude')
plt.xlabel('Latitude')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

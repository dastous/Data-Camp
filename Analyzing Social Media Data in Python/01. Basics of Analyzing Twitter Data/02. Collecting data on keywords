#Collecting data on keywords
#Now that we've set up the authentication, we can begin to collect Twitter data. Recall that with the Streaming API, we will be collecting real-time Twitter data based on either a sample or filtered by a keyword.

#In our example, we will collect data on any tweet mentioning #rstats or #python in the tweet text, username, or user description with the filter endpoint.

#The SListener module has already been defined and imported for you. You can find the full code for this module here.

#Instructions

#Import Stream from tweepy.
#Set keywords_to_track to a list containing #rstats and #python.
#Pass the auth and listen objects to Stream.
#Set the keyword argument track equals to keywords_to_track.

from tweepy import Stream

# Set up words to track
keywords_to_track = ['#rstats','#python']

# Instantiate the SListener object 
listen = SListener(api)

# Instantiate the Stream object
stream = Stream(auth, listen)

# Begin collecting data
stream.filter(track = keywords_to_track)

#Looking for text in all the wrong places
#Recall that relevant text may not only be in the main text field of the tweet. It may also be in the extended_tweet, the retweeted_status, or the quoted_status. We need to check all of these fields to make sure we've accounted for all the of the relevant text. We'll do this often so we're going to create a function which does this.

#The first two lines check if the main text field or the extended_tweet contain the text. You will need to check the rest.

#Finish the check_word_in_tweet function by doing the following:

#Check if the field quoted_status-text contains the word.
#Check if the field quoted_status-extended_tweet-full_text contains the word.
#Check if the field retweeted_status-text contains the word.
#Check if the field retweeted_status-extended_tweet-full_text contains the word.

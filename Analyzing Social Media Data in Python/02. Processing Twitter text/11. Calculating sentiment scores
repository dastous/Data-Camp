#Calculating sentiment scores
#A rough measure of sentiment towards a particular hashtag is to measure average sentiment for tweets mentioning a particular hashtag. It's also possible that other things are happening in that tweet, so it's important to inspect both text as well as metrics generated by automated text methods.

#Print out the first example of a positive tweet. Select the DataFrame with sentiment > 0.6 and use .values to get the full text of the tweet.
#Do the same for negative tweets with the index sentiment < -0.6.
#Generate average sentiment score per day for #python with the index check_word_in_tweet. Use .resample() with argument '1 d'. Then take the mean.
#Do the same with #rstats.

# Print out the text of a positive tweet
print(ds_tweets[sentiment > 0.6]['text'].values[0])

# Print out the text of a negative tweet
print(ds_tweets[sentiment < -0.6]['text'].values[0])

# Generate average sentiment scores for #python
sentiment_py = sentiment[check_word_in_tweet('#python', ds_tweets)].resample('1 d').mean()

# Generate average sentiment scores for #rstats
sentiment_r = sentiment[check_word_in_tweet('#rstats', ds_tweets)].resample('1 d').mean()

#Tweet Items and Tweet Flattening
#There are multiple fields in the Twitter JSON which contains textual data. In a typical tweet, there's the tweet text, the user description, and the user location. In a tweet longer than 140 characters, there's the extended tweet child JSON. And in a quoted tweet, there's the original tweet text and the commentary with the quoted tweet.

#For this exercise, you'll extract textual elements from a single quoted tweet in which the original tweet has more than 140 characters. Then, to analyze tweets at scale, we will want to flatten the tweet JSON into a single level. This will allow us to store the tweets in a DataFrame format.

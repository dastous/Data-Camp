#Finding keywords
#Counting known keywords is one of the first ways you can analyze text data in a Twitter dataset. In this dataset, you're going to count the number of times specific hashtags occur in a collection of tweets about data science. To this end, you're going to use the string methods in the pandas Series object to do this.

#pandas and numpy have been imported as pd and np, respectively. A more fully-featured flatten_tweets and data_science_json have also been loaded for you.

#Instructions

#Flatten the tweets with flatten_tweets() and store them in flat_tweets.
#Convert tweets to DataFrame using the pandas DataFrame constructor.
#Find mentions of #python in 'text', ignoring case.
#Print proportion of tweets mentioning #python by summing python with np.sum() and dividing it by the total number of tweets.

# Flatten the tweets and store them
flat_tweets = flatten_tweets(data_science_json)

# Convert to DataFrame
ds_tweets = pd.DataFrame(flat_tweets)

# Find mentions of #python in 'text'
python = ds_tweets['text'].str.contains('#python', case=False)

# Print proportion of tweets mentioning #python
print("Proportion of #python tweets:", np.sum(python) / python.shape[0])

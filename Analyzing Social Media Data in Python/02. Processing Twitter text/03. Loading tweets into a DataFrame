#Loading tweets into a DataFrame
#Now it's time to import data into a pandas DataFrame so we can analyze tweets at scale.

#We will work with a dataset of tweets which contain the hashtag '#rstats' or '#python'. This dataset is stored as a list of tweet JSON objects in data_science_json.

#This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the pandas basics Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Import pandas (remember, by convention we'll alias it as pd).
#Flatten the data_science_json tweets with flatten_tweets() and store them in tweets.
#Create a DataFrame from tweets using pd.DataFrame().
#Print out the text from the first 5 tweets.

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Flatten the tweets and store in `tweets`
tweets = flatten_tweets(data_science_json)

# Create a DataFrame from `tweets`
ds_tweets = pd.DataFrame(tweets)

# Print out the first 5 tweets from this dataset
print(ds_tweets['text'].values[0:5])

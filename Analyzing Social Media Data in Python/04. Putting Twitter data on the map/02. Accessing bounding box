#Accessing bounding box
#Most tweets which have coordinate-level geographical information attached to them typically come in the form of a bounding box. Bounding boxes are a set of four longitudinal/latitudinal coordinates which denote a particular area in which the user can be located. The bounding box is located in the place value of the Twitter JSON.

#The dataset has been loaded for you as a DataFrame in tweets_sotu.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Complete the getBoundingBox() function by accessing the coordinates value within the bounding box dictionary.
#Apply the getBoundingBox() function to the appropriate column in the tweets_sotu DataFrame.

def getBoundingBox(place):
    """ Returns the bounding box coordinates."""
    return place['bounding_box']['coordinates']

# Apply the function which gets bounding box coordinates
bounding_boxes = tweets_sotu['place'].apply(getBoundingBox)

# Print out the first bounding box coordinates
print(bounding_boxes.values[0])

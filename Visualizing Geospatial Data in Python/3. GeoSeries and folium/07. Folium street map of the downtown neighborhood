#This time you will create the folium map of downtown and add the Urban Residents neighborhood area from urban_polygon. The urban_polygon has been printed to your console.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Create an array called folium_loc from urban_polygon.center
#Create a folium map called downtown_map. Set the location argument equal to folium_loc and initialize the map with a zoom_start of 15.
#Pass the geometry from the urban_polygon GeoDataFrame to the folium.GeoJson() method. Then call add_to() on that.

# Create array for called folium_loc from the urban_polygon center point
point = urban_polygon.center[0]
folium_loc = [point.y, point.x]

# Construct a map from folium_loc: downtown_map
downtown_map = folium.Map(location = folium_loc, zoom_start = 15)

# Draw our neighborhood: Urban Residents
folium.GeoJson(urban_polygon.geometry).add_to(downtown_map)

# Display the map
display(downtown_map)

#Print the urban polygon and notice the units of each longitude/latitude pair.
#Create urban_poly_3857 by calling to_crs() on urban_polygon and print the head again. Notice the units of each longitude/latitude pair have changed.
#Print the area of the urban_poly_3857 geometry. Remember to divide by 10**6 to get kilometers squared.

# Print the head of the urban polygon 
print(urban_polygon.head())

# Create a copy of the urban_polygon using EPSG:3857 and print the head
urban_poly_3857 = urban_polygon.to_crs(epsg = '3857')
print(urban_poly_3857.head())

# Print the area of urban_poly_3857 in kilometers squared
area = urban_poly_3857.geometry.area / 10**6
print('The area of the Urban Residents neighborhood is ', area[0], ' km squared')

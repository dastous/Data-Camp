#Now that you have the center point and the art locations in the units we need to calculate distances in meters, it's time to perform that step.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Import the package to help with pretty printing.
#Create a dictionary, art_distances by iterating through art_dist_meters, using title as the key and the distance() from center as the value. Pass center as the other argument to GeoSeries.distance().
#Pretty print art_distances using the pprint method of pprint.

# Import package for pretty printing
import pprint

# Build a dictionary of titles and distances for Urban Residents art
art_distances = {}
for row in art_dist_meters.iterrows():
    vals = row[1]
    key = vals['title']
    ctr = vals['center']
    art_distances[key] = vals['geometry'].distance(ctr)

# Pretty print the art_distances
pprint.pprint(art_distances)

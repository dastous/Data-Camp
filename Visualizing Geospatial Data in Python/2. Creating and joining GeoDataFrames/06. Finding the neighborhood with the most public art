#Now that you have created art_geo, a GeoDataFrame, from the art DataFrame, you can join it spatially to the neighborhoods data to see what art is in each neighborhood.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Merge the art_geo and neighborhoods GeoDataFrames with a spatial join to create a new GeoDataFrame called neighborhood_art. Find the art that is within neighborhoods.
#Print the first few rows of the neighborhood art GeoDataFrame.

# import packages
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd

# Spatially join neighborhoods with art_geo
neighborhood_art = gpd.sjoin(art_geo, neighborhoods, op = "within")

# Print the first few rows
print(neighborhood_art.head())

#In this exercise you will learn how to find a GeoDataFrame's coordinate reference system and how to change it. The school districts GeoDataFrame is available in your workspace as school_districts.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Print the first row of school_districts and the crs property of this GeoDataFrame.
#Convert the coordinate reference system of school_districts to epsg:3857.
#Print the crs property again to confirm that it was changed.

# Print the first row of school districts GeoDataFrame and the crs
print(school_districts.head(1))
print(school_districts.crs)

# Convert the crs to epsg:3857
school_districts.geometry = school_districts.geometry.to_crs(epsg = 3857)
                        
# Print the first row of school districts GeoDataFrame and the crs again
print(school_districts.head(1))
print(school_districts.crs)

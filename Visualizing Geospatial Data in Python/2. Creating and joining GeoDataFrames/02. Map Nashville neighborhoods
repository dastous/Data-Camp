#This time you'll read a GeoJSON file in to a GeoDataFrame to take a quick peek at where Nashville neighborhoods are.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Import geopandas and matplotlib.pyplot using the customary aliases.
#Read in the neighborhoods GeoJSON file to a GeoDataFrame called neighborhoods and print the first few rows with .head(). The path to this file is stored in a variable called neighborhoods_path.
#Plot neighborhoods coloring the polygons by the name column of the GeoDataFrame and using the Dark2 color map. This time, don't include a legend.
#Show the plot.

import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in the neighborhoods geojson file
neighborhoods = gpd.read_file(neighborhoods_path)

# Print the first few rows of neighborhoods
print(neighborhoods.head())

# Plot the neighborhoods, color according to name and use the Dark2 colormap
neighborhoods.plot(column = 'name', cmap = 'Dark2')

# Show the plot.
plt.show()

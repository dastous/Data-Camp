#You will be using a dataset of the building permits issued in Nashville during 2017. This DataFrame called permits is in your workspace along with the council_districts GeoDataFrame.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Create a Point geometry column in permits from lat and lng.
#Create permits_geo, a GeoDataFrame, using permits, the crs from council_districts, and the geometry from permits.
#Use a spatial join to find permits issued within each council district. Print the first 2 rows.
#Create permit_counts to show the count of permits within each district, using groupby() and .size(). Print permit_counts.

from shapely.geometry import Point

# Create a shapely Point from lat and lng
permits['geometry'] = permits.apply(lambda x: Point((x.lng , x.lat)), axis = 1)

# Build a GeoDataFrame: permits_geo
permits_geo = gpd.GeoDataFrame(permits, crs = council_districts.crs, geometry = permits.geometry)

# Spatial join of permits_geo and council_districts
permits_by_district = gpd.sjoin(permits_geo, council_districts, op = 'within')
print(permits_by_district.head(2))

# Create permit_counts
permit_counts = permits_by_district.groupby(['district']).size()
print(permit_counts)

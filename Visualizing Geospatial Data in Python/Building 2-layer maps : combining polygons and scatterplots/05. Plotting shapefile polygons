#The next step is to show the map of polygons. We have imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt and geopandas as gpd, A GeoDataFrame of the service districts called service_district is in your workspace.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#First plot the service districts without additonal arguments by calling .plot() on the GeoDataFrame.
#Take a look at it with plt.show(). This has been done for you.
#Now use the .plot() method again, but this time add column='name' to color the shapes according to their names and legend=True to see those names. Remember to show the plot.

# Import packages
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the Service Districts without any additional arguments
service_district.plot()
plt.show()

# Plot the Service Districts, color them according to name, and show a legend
service_district.plot(column = 'name', legend = True)
plt.show()

#Now you will create a scatterplot that shows where the Nashville chickens are!

#Instructions
#100 XP
#The path to the chicken dataset is in the variable chickens_path. Use the read_csv function of pandas to load it into a DataFrame called chickens.
#Use the .head() function to look at the first few rows.
#Next add the x and y arguments to plt.scatter() to plot the locations of the Nashville chickens. Use the default marker and color options.
#Show the plot using plt.show().

# Import pandas and matplotlib.pyplot using their customary aliases
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
chickens = pd.read_csv(chickens_path)

# Look at the first few rows of the chickens DataFrame
print(chickens.head())

# Plot the locations of all Nashville chicken permits
plt.scatter(x = chickens.lng, y = chickens.lat)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

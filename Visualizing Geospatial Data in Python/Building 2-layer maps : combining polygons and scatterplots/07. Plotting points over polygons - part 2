#We have loaded the usual libraries as pd, plt, and gpd, the chickens dataset as chickens, and the service districts as service_district. Plot the service districts and chicken permits together to see what story your visualization tells.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Start by plotting the GeoDataFrame with the service districts. Use the name column for your legend color.
#Next plot latitude and longitude from the chicken data to create a scatterplot. Specify 'black' for the marker color and give them a 'white' outline.
#Give the plot a title: 'Nashville Chicken Permits' and label the x-axis as 'longitude' and the y-axis as 'latitude'.
#Add grid lines and show your plot.

# Plot the service district shapefile
service_district.plot(column='name', legend=True)

# Add the chicken locations
plt.scatter(x=chickens.lng, y=chickens.lat, c='black', edgecolor = 'white')


# Add labels and title
plt.title('Nashville Chicken Permits')
plt.xlabel('longitude')
plt.ylabel('latitude')

# Add grid lines and show the plot
plt.grid()
plt.show()

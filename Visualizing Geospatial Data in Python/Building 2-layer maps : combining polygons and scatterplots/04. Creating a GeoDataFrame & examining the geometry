#100 XP
#Import geopandas with its common alias gpd.
#Read in the service district shapefile using geopandas and look at the first 5 rows using the head() method.
#Print the geometry field in the first row (rowname is '0') to see the data contained in that field. You will pass service_district.loc[0, 'geometry'] to the print() function to do this.

# Import geopandas
import geopandas as gpd 

# Read in the services district shapefile and look at the first few rows.
service_district = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path)
print(service_district.head())

# Print the contents of the service districts geometry in the first row
print(service_district.loc[0, 'geometry'])

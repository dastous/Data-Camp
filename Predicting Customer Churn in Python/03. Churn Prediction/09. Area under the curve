#The ROC curve from the previous exercise is viewable on the right. Visually, it looks like a well-performing model. Let's quantify this by computing the area under the curve.

#Instructions 1/2
#50 XP
#Import roc_auc_score from sklearn.metrics.

# Import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

#Instructions 2/2

#Print the area under the ROC curve.

# Import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Print the AUC
print(roc_auc_score(y_test,y_pred_prob))

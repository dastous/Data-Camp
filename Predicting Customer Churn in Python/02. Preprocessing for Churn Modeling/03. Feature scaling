#Recall from the video the different scales of the 'Intl_Calls' and 'Night_Mins' features:
#feature scaling
#Your job in this exercise is to re-scale them using StandardScaler.
#In your workspace, the telco DataFrame has been subset to only include the features you want to rescale: 'Intl_Calls' and 'Night_Mins'. To apply StandardScaler, you need to first instantiate it using StandardScaler(), and then apply the fit_transform() method, passing in the DataFrame you want to rescale. You can do this in one line of code:
#StandardScaler().fit_transform(df)

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Scale telco using StandardScaler() and .fit_transform().
#Print the summary statistics of telco_scaled_df using .describe().

# Import StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale telco using StandardScaler
telco_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(telco)

# Add column names back for readability
telco_scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(telco_scaled, columns=["Intl_Calls", "Night_Mins"])

# Print summary statistics
print(telco_scaled_df.describe())

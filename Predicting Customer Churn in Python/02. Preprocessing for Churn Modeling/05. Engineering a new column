#Leveraging domain knowledge to engineer new features is an essential part of modeling. This quote from Andrew Ng summarizes the importance of feature engineering:
#Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. "Applied machine learning" is basically feature engineering.
#Your job in this exercise is to create a new feature that contains information about the average length of night calls made by customers.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Create a new feature - 'Avg_Night_Calls' - that is the result of dividing 'Night_Mins by 'Night_Calls'.
#Print the first five rows of this new feature.

# Create the new feature
telco['Avg_Night_Calls'] = telco['Night_Mins']/telco['Night_Calls']

# Print the first five rows of 'Avg_Night_Calls'
print(telco['Avg_Night_Calls'].head())

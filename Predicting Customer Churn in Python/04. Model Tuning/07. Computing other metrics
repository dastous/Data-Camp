#In addition to accuracy, let's also compute the F1 score of this new model to get a better picture of model performance.
#A 70-30 train-test split has already been done for you, and all necessary modules have been imported.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Predict the labels of the test set.
#Print the F1 score.

# Import f1_score
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Instantiate the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Fit to the data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print the F1 score
print(f1_score(y_test,y_pred))

#6 new features have been added to the telco DataFrame:

#Region_Code
#Cost_Call
#Total_Charge
#Total_Minutes
#Total_Calls
#Min_Call
#Will this improve the churn model? Let's find out!

# Create training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)

#Instructions 2/3

#Your random forest classifier from earlier exercises has been fit to the telco data and is available to you as clf. Let's visualize the feature importances and get a sense for what the drivers of churn are, using matplotlib's barh to create a horizontal bar plot of feature importances.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Calculate the feature importances of clf.
#Use plt.barh() to create a horizontal bar plot of importances.

# Calculate feature importances
importances = clf.feature_importances_

# Create plot
plt.barh(range(X.shape[1]), importances)
plt.show()

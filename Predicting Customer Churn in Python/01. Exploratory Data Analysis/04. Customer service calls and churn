#You've already seen that there's not much of a difference in account lengths between churners and non-churners, but that there is a difference in the number of customer service calls left by churners.
#Let's now visualize this difference using a box plot and incorporate other features of interest - do customers who have international plans make more customer service calls? Or do they tend to churn more? How about voicemail plans? Let's find out!
#Recall the syntax for creating a box plot using seaborn:
#sns.boxplot(x = "X-axis variable",
#            y = "Y-axis variable",
#            data = DataFrame)
#If you want to remove outliers, you can specify the additional parameter sym="", and you can add a third variable using hue.

#Instructions 1/4

#Create a box plot with 'Churn' on the x-axis and 'CustServ_Calls' on the y-axis.

# Import matplotlib and seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create the box plot
sns.boxplot(x = 'Churn',
          y = 'CustServ_Calls',
          data = telco)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

#There is a very noticeable difference here between churners and non-churners! Now, remove the outliers from the box plot.

# Import matplotlib and seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create the box plot
sns.boxplot(x = 'Churn',
            y = 'CustServ_Calls',
            data = telco,
            sym = "")

# Display the plot
plt.show()

#Add a third variable to this plot - 'Vmail_Plan' - to visualize whether or not having a voice mail plan affects the number of customer service calls or churn.

# Import matplotlib and seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Add "Vmail_Plan" as a third variable
sns.boxplot(x = 'Churn',
            y = 'CustServ_Calls',
            data = telco,
            sym = "",
            hue = "Vmail_Plan")

# Display the plot
plt.show()

#Not much of a difference there. Update your code so that the third variable is 'Intl_Plan' instead.

# Import matplotlib and seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Add "Intl_Plan" as a third variable
sns.boxplot(x = 'Churn',
            y = 'CustServ_Calls',
            data = telco,
            sym = "",
            hue = "Intl_Plan")

# Display the plot
plt.show()

#List the poorest and richest countries worldwide
#The values of numerical variables are numbers. They can be described by measures of central tendency, or the most typical value in a dataset, and dispersion, which represents the spread of a distribution.

#In the next few exercises, you will use these statistics to explore the data in 'per_capita_income.csv', which contains the average income earned per person in a given country. The first step in analyzing aspects of the global income distribution is to inspect and familiarize yourself with the data.

#pandas has been imported as pd.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Load the 'per_capita_income.csv' file into income. No additional arguments other than the file name are needed. (Note that this is a csv file.)
#Inspect the column names and data types with .info().
#Using .sort_values(), sort (in descending order) the income DataFrame by the column which contains the income information.
#Display the first five rows of income using .head() and the last five rows using .tail().


# Import the data
income = pd.read_csv('per_capita_income.csv')

# Inspect the result
income.info()

# Sort the data by income
income = income.sort_values('Income per Capita', ascending=False)

# Display the first and last five rows
print(income.head())
print(income.tail())

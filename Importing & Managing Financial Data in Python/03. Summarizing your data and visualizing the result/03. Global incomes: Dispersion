#Global incomes: Dispersion
#A quantile is a measure of dispersion created by dividing a frequency distribution of a DataFrame into even groups. You can return values at the given quantile q of a DataFrame df with the command df.quantile(q); likewise, supplying a list as q will return a value for each given quantile.

#Here, you will continue your analysis of global income distribution using two measures of dispersion: the standard deviation, or square root of variance, and the interquartile range (IQR).

#pandas has been imported as pd, and the income DataFrame from the previous exercise is in your workspace.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Using the appropriate functions, calculate the mean of income per capita as mean and the standard deviation as std.
#Without using .quantile(), calculate and print the upper and lower bounds of an interval of one standard deviation around the mean in a list bounds:
#subtract std from mean as the first element
#add std to mean as the second element
#Using .quantile() and a list of two appropriate decimal values, calculate and print the first and the third quartile of 'Income per Capita' as quantiles. Do the values match?
#Calculate and print the IQR, iqr, using the simple subtraction expression you learned in the video.

# Calculate mean
mean = income['Income per Capita'].mean()

# Calculate standard deviation
std = income['Income per Capita'].std()

# Calculate and print lower and upper bounds
bounds = [mean-std, mean+std]
print(bounds)

# Calculate and print first and third quartiles
quantiles = income['Income per Capita'].quantile([0.25, 0.75])
print(quantiles)

# Calculate and print IQR
iqr = quantiles[0.75] - quantiles[0.25]
print(iqr)

#Visualizing international income distribution
#seaborn is a Python visualization library for statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.

#By default, the distplot() function in the seaborn package creates a histogram, where data is grouped into ranges and and plotted as bars, and fits a kernel density estimation (KDE), or smoothed histogram. You can also use distplot() to create another kind of graph called a rugplot, which adds markers at the bottom of the chart to indicate the density of observations along the x axis.

#seaborn.distplot(a, bins=None, hist=True, kde=True, rug=False, ...)
#In previous exercises, you created a quantile plot which provided a fairly granular sense of the level of income per capita at different points of the distribution. Here, you will use distplot() to get the full picture!

#pandas has been imported as pd, and the income DataFrame from the previous exercise is available in your workspace.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Import seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
#Print the summary statistics provided by .describe().
#Plot and show a basic histogram of the 'Income per Capita' column with .distplot().
#Create and show a rugplot of the same data by setting the additional arguments bins equal to 50, kde to False, and rug to True.

# Import seaborn and matplotlib
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Print the summary statistics for income
print(income.describe())

# Plot a basic histogram of income per capita
sns.distplot(income['Income per Capita'])

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Plot a rugplot
sns.distplot(income['Income per Capita'], bins=50, kde=False, rug=True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

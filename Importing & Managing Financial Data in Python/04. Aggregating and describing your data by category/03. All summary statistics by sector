#All summary statistics by sector
#You can apply the various summary statistics that you have learned about in the last chapter to a groupby object to obtain the result on a per-category basis. This includes the .describe() function, which provides several insights all at once!

#Here, you will practice this with the NASDAQ listings. pandas has been imported as pd, and the NASDAQ stock exchange listings data is available in your workspace in the nasdaq DataFrame.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Inspect the nasdaq data using .info().
#Create a new column market_cap_m that contains the market cap in millions of USD. On the next line, drop the column 'Market Capitalization'.
#Group your nasdaq data by 'Sector' and assign to nasdaq_by_sector.
#Call the method .describe() on nasdaq_by_sector, assign to summary, and print the result.
#This works, but result is in long format and uses a pd.MultiIndex() that you saw earlier. Convert summary to wide format by calling .unstack().

# Inspect NASDAQ data
nasdaq.info()

# Create market_cap_m
nasdaq['market_cap_m'] = nasdaq['Market Capitalization'].div(1e6)

# Drop the Market Capitalization column
nasdaq.drop('Market Capitalization', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Group nasdaq by Sector
nasdaq_by_sector = nasdaq.groupby('Sector')

# Create summary statistics by sector
summary = nasdaq_by_sector.describe()

# Print the summary
print(summary)

# Unstack 
summary = summary.unstack()

# Print the summary again
print(summary)

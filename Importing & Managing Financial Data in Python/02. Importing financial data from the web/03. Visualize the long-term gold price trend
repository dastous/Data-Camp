#Visualize the long-term gold price trend
#In the previous video, you learned how to retrieve data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) portal.

#Here, you will use this new data source to visualize the gold price trend over the last 50 years, specifically, the Gold Fixing Price 10:30 AM (London time) in London Bullion Market, in US Dollars. DataReader, date, pandas as pd, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt have been imported.

#Instructions

#Use date() to set start to January 1, 1968, and set series to series code 'GOLDAMGBD228NLBM'.
#Pass series as the data,'fred' as the data source, and start as the start date to DataReader(). Assign to gold_price.
#Inspect gold_price using .info().
#Plot and show the gold_price series with title 'Gold Price'.

# Set start date
start = date(1968,1,1)

# Set series code
series = 'GOLDAMGBD228NLBM'

# Import the data
gold_price = DataReader(series, data_source='fred', start=start)

# Inspect the price of gold
gold_price.info()

# Plot the price of gold
gold_price.plot(title='Gold Price')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

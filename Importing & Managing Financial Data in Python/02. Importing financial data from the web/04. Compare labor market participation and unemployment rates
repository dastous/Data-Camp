#Compare labor market participation and unemployment rates
#Two economic data series in FRED are the Civilian Unemployment Rate ('UNRATE') and the Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate ('CIVPART').

#These rates highlight two important aspects of the US labor market: the share of the civilian population that is currently unemployed or seeking employment, and the share of those active in the labor market that are in fact employed.

#This means that the numbers indicate both the size of the labor market relative to the total population, as well as the size of unemployment relative to the labor market.

#Here, you will import, modify, and plot the data. DataReader, date, pandas as pd, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt have been imported.

#Instructions
#100 XP
#Using date(), set start to January 1, 1950.
#Create series as a list containing the series codes 'UNRATE' and 'CIVPART', in that order.
#Pass series, the data source 'fred', and the start date to DataReader(), and assign the result to econ_data.
#Use the .columns attribute to assign 'Unemployment Rate' and 'Participation Rate' as the new column labels.
#Plot and show econ_data using the subplots=True argument, and title it 'Labor Market'.

# Set the start date
start = date(1950,1,1)

# Define the series codes
series = ['UNRATE', 'CIVPART']

# Import the data
econ_data = DataReader(series, data_source='fred', start=start)

# Assign new column labels
econ_data.columns = ['Unemployment Rate', 'Participation Rate']

# Plot econ_data
econ_data.plot(title='Labor Market',subplots=True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

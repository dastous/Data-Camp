#Automate the loading and combining of data from multiple Excel worksheets
#You are now ready to automate the import process of listing information from all three exchanges in the Excel file listings.xlsx by implementing a for loop. Let's look at what you'll do:

#Retrieve the sheet names of a pd.ExcelFile() object using its sheet_names attribute.
#Create an empty list.
#Write a for loop that iterates through these sheet names to read the data from the corresponding sheet name in the Excel file into a variable. Add a reference column, if desired. Append the contents of this variable to the list with each iteration.
#Concatenate the DataFrames in the list.
#As always, refer to the previous exercises in this chapter or the pandas documentation if you need any help. pandas has been imported as pd.

#Create the pd.ExcelFile() object using the file listings.xlsx and assign to the variable xls.
#Retrieve the sheet names from the .sheet_names attribute of xls and assign to exchanges.
#Create an empty list and assign to the variable listings.
#Iterate over exchanges using a for loop with exchange as iterator variable. In each iteration:
#Use pd.read_excel() with xls as the the data source, exchange as the sheetname argument, and 'n/a' as na_values to address missing values. Assign the result to listing.
#Create a new column in listing called 'Exchange' with the value exchange (the iterator variable).
#Append the resulting listing DataFrame to listings.
#Use pd.concat() to concatenate the contents of listings and assign to listing_data.
#Inspect the contents of listing_data using .info().

# Create the pd.ExcelFile() object
xls = pd.ExcelFile('listings.xlsx')

# Extract the sheet names from xls
exchanges = xls.sheet_names

# Create an empty list: listings
listings=[]

# Import the data
for exchange in exchanges:
    listing = pd.read_excel(xls, sheetname=exchange, na_values='n/a')
    listing['Exchange'] = exchange
    listings.append(listing)

# Concatenate the listings: listing_data
listing_data = pd.concat(listings)

# Inspect the results
listing_data.info()
